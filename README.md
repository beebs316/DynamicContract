# DynamicContract
Dynamic smart contract and webtool to interact with it.

Each token in the collection has the ability to be in one of 4 different phases. 
The phases can be changed by interacting with the contract directly or using the web tool.
The rate that the phase can be changed is determined by a time delay. 
Each time the phase is changed the token uri and metadata is updated.
The web tool allows the token holder to read out the current phase as well as write a value to cycle to the next phase.
